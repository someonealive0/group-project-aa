# COMP3120 Group AA Application - Lighthouse Realtime Chat

This group project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Project Outline
The application we have created is a messaging platform where users can communicate with each other in real-time; taking inspiration form the popular messaging platform [Discord](https://discord.com/). Users are able to communicate with each other or, if they prefer, create groups where they can message other users who are also part of that group. This project was aimed at capturing a young demographic by creating a simple, clutter-free interface that allows communication without any distraction. We aimed to build a fully featured application but with the tight time constrainsts were limited to what we could achieve; especially working with new components and on new platforms including [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).  

## Description of MVP
The MVP was able to include the functionality we aimed for at the outset in the project proposal. These include:
- User registration and login
- User sign-out
- Creating chat groups
- Joining groups
- View user profiles
- Unique user profile images
- Group Images
- Real-time messaging (appears as each user posts, continuously scrolls to the latest message)
- Multiple views (for each group chat)

As mentioned, the limited project timeline meant we needed to work efficiently. We first set up the firebase and Github repositories, created a base application and implemented some basic functionality. We then decided on what features we would like to implement and what was possible in the given timeframe. With the remaining time we populated the database, implemented the listed features, revised the features, implemented some styling and worked on more (some unsuccessfully, which we have included below to look at in the future).

## Next Steps in the Future
On the outset of this project, our group was aiming to implement many additional features and functionality compared to what was achieved in the end. The group hoped to create a much more complex web application but understood that the limited time would result in a less featured MVP. The deployed application contains the base components for the application but our proposal listed some more comprehensive additions that we would like to add in the future including:
- Auido feedback for actions when receiving messages
- Implementing a News API that sends through the latest headline every 'x' minutes into the messaging feed
- Automated messages (similar to News API; a bot that would display automated messages at given increments)
- Implement testing for all components (unsuccessfully implemented, removed due to not functioning correctly with firebase)
- Creating and switching between sub-groups
- Video embedding
- Audio messaging
- Content filters
